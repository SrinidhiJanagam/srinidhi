The standard deviation for 'age' was found to be approximately 14.05 years, indicating a moderate spread around the mean age. For 'BMI', the standard deviation was around 6.10 units, reflecting variability in body mass index within the dataset. The charges exhibited a significantly higher standard deviation of approximately 12110.01 USD, underscoring wide variations in healthcare costs among individuals.\n",

BMI ranged from approximately 15.96 to 53.13, illustrating the spectrum of body mass indices recorded. Charges, ranging from approximately 1121.87 to 63770.43 USD, highlighted the extensive disparity in healthcare expenses covered by insurance.\n",

        "Utilizing the scipy.stats library, modes were determined for each variable. The mode for age was 18 years, reflecting the most frequently occurring age in the dataset. For BMI, the mode was 32.3, indicating a prevalent body mass index category among insured individuals. In terms of charges, the mode was 1639.56 USD, representing the most common healthcare cost incurred.\n",
